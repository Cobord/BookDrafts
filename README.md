## Low Dimensional Physics

Mainly about quantum field theries in less than 3 spatial dimensions. For early chapters including ordinary quantum mechanics due to it's interpretation as 0 dimensional. Focus on exactly solvable cases whether from Yang-Baxter integrability, 2D conformal symmetry or topological invariance.

## Super Field Theories

The sort of supersymmetric field theories that are referenced for pure math applications (particularly geometric representation theory). Particularly those appearing as descendents of Theory X in 6 dimensions.

## Basic Book

## Accompanying Scripts

Some of the concepts descibed in the books have accompanying scripts that demonstrate them.

- Quiver - See the Nakajima Appendix of Super Field Theories
- Cactus Group - The cactus group is relevant for coboundary categories and Bethe vectors. Concepts related to these appear in both books. It is explicitly described in Low Dimensional Physics where Bethe vectors have more focus.
- Nilpotent Orbits - Used in Super Field Theories, specifically see Little String Theory Defects and Bala-Carter
- Symplectic Capacities - Not mentioned too much, but look for the concepts related to Floer theory in Super Field Theories. Specifically look for passing mention of ECH (Embedded Contact Homology).
- Plabic Graphs, Triangulations, Le Diagrams, Total Nonnegativity, Amplitudehedron - Has been moved to github.com/cobord/plabic in order to form a self contined package available via pip
