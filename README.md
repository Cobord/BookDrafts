## Low Dimensional Physics

Mainly about quantum field theries in less than 3 spatial dimensions. For early chapters including ordinary quantum mechanics due to it's interpretation as 0 dimensional. Focus on exactly solvable cases whether from Yang-Baxter integrability, 2D conformal symmetry or topological invariance.

## Super Field Theories

The sort of supersymmetric field theories that are referenced for pure math applications. Particularly those appearing as descendents of Theory X in 6 dimensions.
